## Description

I Built this project to help business owners take notes so that they can organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks that need to be completed. This application allows users to write and save notes. In order to build this project I had to apply new skill sets that I've learned throughout the module. This is what motivate me in creating this project, to see it come to life and be beneficial to ever business owner user out there and make it easier to write down thier notes. This application was made to be user-friendly and easy to guide through. At the loading page you're presented with a "Get Started" button to load into the notes page. This is where the user is able to input his Note Title and Note text on the empty field to the right side of page and see existing notes on the left column. The Save icon allows user to save his note created into the existing list where he can later see and go through any notes later. In order to build this project I had to apply some new skills sets to have it fucntioning properly. I had to get familiar with npm Express package inorder to build the back end and retrieve note data from a JSON file. This allowed me to connect with the front end. A proper server.js file had to be created for proper use of imported modules that was exported when creating routes for Api requests and html files. In order to be able to use other files in public folder and routes, proper middleware had to be applied. This allowed me to get a better understanding of routing/router using express. With these skills applied I was able to get this project to operate as it should. It was a great experience to create a Note Taker application that will help users take appropriate notes in a easy matter as writing and saving it.
